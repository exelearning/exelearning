## About the Project

eXeLearning 3.0 is a modern re-implementation of the original eXeLearning authoring tool, initially created in the eXeLearning.org project in New Zealand and subsequently continued by eXeLearning.net project by the Spanish Ministry of Education, Vocational Training and Sports (MEFPD) through Cedec-INTEF.

The new code has been created within the collaboration between the MEFPD and the regional educational administrations of AndalucÃ­a and Extremadura. The revision and further developments of eXe 3.0 are carried out also with the participation of other regional administrations (Canarias, Madrid, Comunidad Valenciana and Galicia).

This version is built with modern technologies (PHP 8, Symfony 7) and provides an accessible and up-to-date user interface for creating interactive educational content.

### Key Features

* Creation and edition of interactive educational content
* Multiple iDevices (interactive elements)
* Multilingual support
* Exportation to various formats
* Moodle integration
* Real-time collaborative features powered by [Mercure](https://mercure.rocks/)
* Modern and accessible interface built with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* Multiple authentication methods (Password, CAS, OpenID Connect)
* Compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite databases
* Offline installers supported via [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [nativePHP](https://nativephp.com/)

### Built With

* [![PHP][PHP.badge]][PHP-url]
* [![Symfony][Symfony.badge]][Symfony-url]
* [![Docker][Docker.badge]][Docker-url]

## Quick Start

First install Docker if you don't have it yet. Then...

To try out eXeLearning instantly, run:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name exelearning exelearning/exelearning
```

Then create a user:

```bash
docker exec -it exelearning php bin/console app:create-user user@exelearning.net 1234 demouser --no-fail
```

This will start eXeLearning at `http://localhost:8080` with your custom user.

Offline installers for Linux, Windows and macOS are also available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/exelearning/exelearning/releases). The online version is recommended for most use cases.

## Deployment

To deploy eXeLearning in a production environment, see:

ðŸ“¦ [doc/05-deployment.md](./doc/05-deployment.md)

## Development Environment

See [doc/03-development-environment.md](./doc/03-development-environment.md) for full setup instructions.

To start developing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/exelearning/exelearning.git
cd exelearning
make up
```

This will start all services and make the app available at `http://localhost:8080`.

More development tools, options, and real-time collaboration info are documented in the `doc/` folder.

## Project Structure

The application follows the standard Symfony project structure, with some specific folders for managing iDevices and educational resources.
